## A funny story
Rather quaint than funny, but when I was little I once gave a rather gruesome answer to my kindergarten teacher's question: "Who can tell me what rabits eat?" 
Having lost my finger to a rabbit's bite I happily replied: " rabbits eat carrots and spit blood". Needless to say the teacher was quite shocked :)

### TL;DR
Rabbits eat carrots and spit blood.
